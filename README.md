# Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a synthetic data generation pipeline. The pipeline utilizes **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, and **pandas** for generating synthetic datasets and automatic responses.

## Pipeline Workflow

### Synthetic Dataset Generation

1. **Load Initial Dataset**
   - Retrieve the dataset from Hugging Face.
   - Extract questions from the dataset.

2. **Preprocess Data**
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Remove punctuation.
   - Note: Lemmatization is not applied to preserve word diversity for natural text generation.

3. **Construct Prompt**
   - Create a prompt by combining the input question with a modification instruction.

4. **Generate Synthetic Questions**
   - Use OpenAI's API to generate synthetic questions based on the constructed prompt.

5. **Save Dataset**
   - Save the generated questions to `questions.csv`.

### Automatic Response Generation

1. **Generate Responses**
   - Use the `generate_response` function to create both correct and incorrect responses for each question.
   - The function utilizes OpenAI's API, with the `chosen` parameter determining the response type.

2. **Save Responses**
   - Save questions along with their chosen and rejected responses to `questions_and_responses.csv`.

## Quality Evaluation

### Linguistic Quality

- **Fluency**: Ensure grammatical correctness and logical flow.
- **Coherence**: Ensure logical alignment with questions.

### Domain-Specific Accuracy

- **Factual Accuracy**: Verify medically accurate and current information.
- **Consistency**: Ensure responses align with generally accepted healthcare information.
- **Relevance**: Ensure responses are directly relevant to the questions.
- **Misinformation Rate**: Ensure rejected responses are clearly incorrect.

### Evaluation Methods

- **Automated Checks**: Use specialized LLMs and tools like Grammarly.
- **Manual Review**: Engage healthcare professionals for manual assessment.
- **User Satisfaction Testing**: Gather feedback from end-users.

## Domain Adaptation

### Challenges

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**
   - **Solution**: Train or fine-tune models on domain-specific datasets.

2. **Modification List Alignment**
   - **Solution**: Automate and validate modification lists with domain experts.

3. **Data Quality and Reliability**
   - **Solution**: Implement enhanced validation and expert reviews.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**
   - **Solution**: Ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines.

### Adaptation Strategies

1. **Modular Design**: Create a flexible architecture for easy domain-specific component swapping.
2. **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Develop evaluation metrics tailored to the new domain.
3. **Expert Collaboration**: Involve domain experts in development and evaluation.

## Lessons Learned and Next Steps

- Utilize frameworks like [Cosmopedia](https://github.com/huggingface/cosmopedia/tree/main/generation) and [llm-swarm](https://github.com/huggingface/llm-swarm/tree/loubna/examples/textbooks) for scalability.
- Implement `slurm` for efficient processing, noting hardware requirements.

By following these guidelines, the pipeline can be effectively deployed and adapted to various domains, ensuring high-quality synthetic data generation and response accuracy.
